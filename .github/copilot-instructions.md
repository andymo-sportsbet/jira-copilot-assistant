## Command 1: Create JIRA Ticket

### Trigger Phrases
- "create jira ticket"
- "create ticket from this file"
- "make a jira issue"
- "new jira ticket"
- "create jira from spec"
- "add to jira"

### When to Use
When the user has a specification, feature description, or documentation file open and wants to create a JIRA ticket from it.

### Process

1. **Read the current file** to extract information
2. **Extract key elements**:
   - **Title/Summary**: 
     - First `# Heading` (remove the `#` symbol)
     - Or first line if no heading
     - Limit to 100 characters
   
   - **Description**: 
     - Look for `## Description`, `## Overview`, or `## Summary` section
     - Or use first paragraph after title
     - Limit to 500 characters
   
   - **Features/Requirements**: 
     - Look for sections: `## Features`, `## Requirements`, `## Acceptance Criteria`
     - Extract bullet points (`-` or `*` lists)
     - Join with commas (max 10 features)
   
   - **Priority**:
     - **High**: If keywords found: "urgent", "critical", "blocker", "asap", "emergency", "highest"
     - **Low**: If keywords found: "nice to have", "future", "optional", "low priority", "lowest"
     - **Medium**: Default if no keywords found

3. **Generate command**:
```bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-create.sh \
  --summary "Extracted Title Here" \
  --description "Extracted description here..." \
  --features "Feature1,Feature2,Feature3"
```

4. **Provide explanation**:
   - Explain what the command will do
   - Mention the file being used as source
   - Suggest reviewing the extracted data before running

### Example Interaction

**User**: "create jira ticket from this file"

**Current File** (`specs/user-auth.md`):
```markdown
# User Authentication System

## Description
Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication with JWT tokens and refresh mechanism.

## Features
- Google OAuth integration
- GitHub OAuth integration  
- JWT token generation
- Token refresh mechanism
- MFA support

Priority: High
```

**Your Response**:
```
I'll create a JIRA ticket from `specs/user-auth.md`. Here's the command:

\`\`\`bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-create.sh \
  --summary "User Authentication System" \
  --description "Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication with JWT tokens and refresh mechanism" \
  --features "Google OAuth integration,GitHub OAuth integration,JWT token generation,Token refresh mechanism,MFA support"
\`\`\`

**What this does**:
- Creates a Story in your JIRA project (MSPOC)
- Adds the 'copilot-created' label
- Returns the ticket key (e.g., MSPOC-123) and URL

I detected **High** priority based on the "Priority: High" text in the file.

Please review the extracted information and run when ready!
```

## Command 2: Groom JIRA Ticket

### Trigger Phrases
- "groom PROJ-123"
- "enhance ticket PROJ-45"
- "update jira PROJ-67"
- "improve PROJ-89"
- "add criteria to PROJ-123"

### When to Use
When the user wants to enhance an existing JIRA ticket with additional acceptance criteria and GitHub context.

### Process

1. **Extract ticket key**: Match pattern `[A-Z]+-\d+` (e.g., PROJ-123, MSPOC-456)
2. **Generate command**:
```bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-groom.sh PROJ-123
```

3. **Explain what happens**:
   - Fetches current ticket from JIRA
   - Searches GitHub for related PRs and commits
   - Generates 5 additional acceptance criteria
   - Updates ticket description with enhancements
   - Adds comment with changes made

### Example Interaction

**User**: "groom MSPOC-86"

**Your Response**:
```
I'll enhance ticket MSPOC-86 with AI-generated improvements:

\`\`\`bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-groom.sh MSPOC-86
\`\`\`

**What this does**:
1. Fetches MSPOC-86 from JIRA
2. Searches GitHub for related PRs/commits mentioning MSPOC-86
3. Generates 5 additional acceptance criteria based on best practices
4. Adds implementation notes if related PRs are found
5. Updates the ticket description with enhancements
6. Adds a comment summarizing the changes

This typically adds 5 new acceptance criteria and references to related GitHub work.

Run when ready!
```

---

## Command 3: Close JIRA Ticket

### Trigger Phrases
- "close PROJ-123"
- "mark PROJ-45 done"
- "finish PROJ-67"
- "complete ticket PROJ-89"
- "done with PROJ-123"

### When to Use
When the user has completed work on a ticket and wants to mark it as done.

### Process

1. **Extract ticket key**: Match pattern `[A-Z]+-\d+`
2. **Generate command**:
```bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-close.sh PROJ-123
```

3. **Explain what happens**:
   - Fetches ticket details
   - Generates completion summary
   - Adds summary as final comment
   - Transitions ticket to "Done" status

### Example Interaction

**User**: "close MSPOC-85"

**Your Response**:
```
I'll close MSPOC-85:

\`\`\`bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-close.sh MSPOC-85
\`\`\`

**What this does**:
- Fetches ticket details from JIRA
- Generates a completion summary based on the description and acceptance criteria
- Adds the summary as a final comment
- Transitions the ticket to "Done" status
- Outputs confirmation with ticket URL

Run when ready to mark this ticket as complete!
```

---

## Command 4: Sync GitHub Repositories with JIRA

### Trigger Phrases
- "sync jira"
- "sync jira with github"
- "update jira from github"
- "sync repos"
- "sync github prs"

### When to Use
When the user wants to automatically update JIRA ticket statuses based on GitHub PR states.

### Process

1. **Check if specific repo mentioned**
   - If yes: `./scripts/jira-sync.sh --repo owner/repo`
   - If no: `./scripts/jira-sync.sh` (all repos)

2. **Check for custom days lookback**
   - If mentioned (e.g., "last 14 days"): `--days 14`
   - Default: last 7 days

### Example Interaction

**User**: "sync jira with github"

**Your Response**:
```
I'll sync all repositories with JIRA:

\`\`\`bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-sync.sh
\`\`\`

**What this does**:
1. Lists all repos in your GitHub org (andymo-sportsbet)
2. Scans recent commits and PRs (last 7 days) for JIRA keys
3. Updates ticket statuses based on PR state:
   - Open PR ‚Üí Transitions ticket to "In Progress"
   - Merged PR ‚Üí Transitions ticket to "Done"
4. Reports summary: X tickets updated, Y errors

This may take 15-30 seconds for organizations with many repos.

Run when ready!
```

**Or for specific repo**:

**User**: "sync jira for My-projects repo"

**Your Response**:
```
I'll sync just the My-projects repository:

\`\`\`bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-sync.sh --repo andymo-sportsbet/My-projects
\`\`\`

This will only scan `andymo-sportsbet/My-projects` instead of all repos.
```

---

## Advanced: Natural Language Processing

### When User Uses Vague Commands

**User**: "help with jira"

**Your Response**:
```
I can help with JIRA tickets! Here are the available commands:

**Create new ticket** from current file:
\`./scripts/jira-create.sh\` - Extracts title, description, and features

**Enhance existing ticket** with acceptance criteria:
\`./scripts/jira-groom.sh PROJ-XXX\` - Adds criteria and GitHub context

**Close ticket** when work is complete:
\`./scripts/jira-close.sh PROJ-XXX\` - Marks as Done with summary

**Sync with GitHub** to auto-update statuses:
\`./scripts/jira-sync.sh\` - Updates tickets based on PR states

What would you like to do?
```

### When File Has No Clear Structure

**User**: "create jira ticket"

**Current File**: Plain text or unclear structure

**Your Response**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è I couldn't extract clear requirements from this file.

The file doesn't have standard headings (# Title, ## Description, etc.).

You can create a ticket manually:

\`\`\`bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-create.sh \
  --summary "Your ticket title here" \
  --description "Ticket description here" \
  --features "Feature1,Feature2,Feature3"
\`\`\`

Or, would you like me to help structure this file first?
```

---

## Error Handling

### Invalid Ticket Key

**User**: "groom INVALID-999"

**Your Response**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è The ticket key "INVALID-999" might not exist in JIRA.

Make sure the ticket key follows the format: PROJECT-123 (e.g., MSPOC-86)

You can try running the command anyway:

\`\`\`bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-groom.sh INVALID-999
\`\`\`

The script will show a clear error if the ticket doesn't exist.
```

### Missing Environment Setup

**User**: "create jira ticket"

**If user hasn't set up `.env` yet**:

**Your Response**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your JIRA environment is configured first!

**One-time setup**:

1. Copy the environment template:
\`\`\`bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
cp .env.example .env
\`\`\`

2. Edit `.env` with your credentials:
- JIRA_BASE_URL (your Atlassian instance)
- JIRA_EMAIL (your email)
- JIRA_API_TOKEN (get from https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
- JIRA_PROJECT (your project key, e.g., MSPOC)

3. Then run the create command:
\`\`\`bash
source .env
./scripts/jira-create.sh --summary "..." --description "..."
\`\`\`

Need help with any step?
```

---

## Context Awareness

### File Type Detection

- **Markdown files** (`.md`): Extract headings, sections, lists
- **Text files** (`.txt`): Use first line as title, rest as description
- **Code files**: Suggest creating ticket for implementation
- **No file open**: Ask for manual input or to open a file

### Priority Detection Keywords

- **High/Urgent**: urgent, critical, blocker, asap, emergency, highest, high priority, p0, p1
- **Low**: nice to have, future, optional, low priority, lowest, p3, p4, wishlist
- **Medium** (default): everything else

### Feature Extraction Patterns

Look for sections with these headings:
- Features, Requirements, Acceptance Criteria
- User Stories, Use Cases, Scenarios  
- Tasks, Todo, Checklist
- Deliverables, Objectives, Goals

Extract bullet points marked with:
- `-` (dash)
- `*` (asterisk)
- Numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`, etc.)

---

## Best Practices

### Always:
1. ‚úÖ Show the complete command for transparency
2. ‚úÖ Explain what the command will do
3. ‚úÖ Mention the source file being used (for create commands)
4. ‚úÖ Suggest reviewing before running
5. ‚úÖ Include the expected output/result

### Never:
1. ‚ùå Execute commands automatically without user consent
2. ‚ùå Assume file structure - check and adapt
3. ‚ùå Ignore error scenarios - always handle gracefully
4. ‚ùå Forget to mention `cd jira-copilot-assistant` and `source .env`

---

## Example Complete Workflow

**User opens** `specs/payment-integration.md`:
```markdown
# Payment Gateway Integration

## Description
Integrate Stripe payment processing with support for subscriptions and one-time payments.

## Requirements
- Stripe SDK integration
- Webhook handling
- Subscription management
- Payment history
- Refund processing

## Priority
This is critical for Q4 launch.
```

**User**: "create jira ticket and then groom it"

**Your Response**:
```
I'll help you create and groom a JIRA ticket from `specs/payment-integration.md`!

**Step 1: Create the ticket**

\`\`\`bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-create.sh \
  --summary "Payment Gateway Integration" \
  --description "Integrate Stripe payment processing with support for subscriptions and one-time payments" \
  --features "Stripe SDK integration,Webhook handling,Subscription management,Payment history,Refund processing"
\`\`\`

I detected **High** priority based on "critical" keyword.

**Step 2: After creation, groom the ticket**

Once you have the ticket key (e.g., MSPOC-87), run:

\`\`\`bash
./scripts/jira-groom.sh MSPOC-87
\`\`\`

This will add acceptance criteria and search for related GitHub work.

Ready to proceed? Run the create command first!
```

## Command 5: Create JIRA Ticket from Confluence Page

### Trigger Phrases
- "create jira ticket from this confluence page"
- "create jira from confluence"
- "convert confluence page to jira"
- "make jira ticket from confluence"
- User pastes a Confluence URL

### When to Use
When the user provides a Confluence page URL or page ID and wants to create a JIRA ticket from the Confluence content.

### URL Detection
Detect Confluence URLs matching these patterns:
- `https://[domain].atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/[SPACE]/pages/[PAGE_ID]/[TITLE]`
- `https://[domain].atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=[PAGE_ID]`
- `https://[domain].atlassian.net/wiki/display/[SPACE]/[TITLE]`

Extract the numeric page ID from the URL.

### Process

1. **Identify Confluence URL or page ID** in user's message
2. **Extract page ID** from URL if needed (numeric ID like `12907938514`)
3. **Determine project key**:
   - Use from context if mentioned
   - Ask user if not clear
   - Use `JIRA_PROJECT` from environment as default
4. **Suggest the command** with explanation

### Command Format

```bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/confluence-to-jira.sh \
  --url "https://[domain].atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/[SPACE]/pages/[PAGE_ID]/" \
  --project <PROJECT_KEY>

# Or with page ID directly
./scripts/confluence-to-jira.sh \
  --page-id "[PAGE_ID]" \
  --project <PROJECT_KEY>

# Optional: specify priority
./scripts/confluence-to-jira.sh \
  --url "<CONFLUENCE_URL>" \
  --project <PROJECT_KEY> \
  --priority High
```

### What It Does

The script will:
1. Fetch the Confluence page using REST API
2. Extract title ‚Üí JIRA summary
3. Extract "Overview", "Description", or "Summary" section ‚Üí JIRA description
4. Extract bullet/numbered lists ‚Üí Requirements/features
5. Detect priority from labels and keywords
6. Create JIRA ticket with extracted data
7. Add link back to Confluence page in ticket description

### Example Interaction

**User**: "create jira ticket from this confluence page: https://sportsbet.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DATAFEEDS/pages/12907938514/"

**Copilot Response**:
```
I'll create a JIRA ticket from that Confluence page. Run this command:

\`\`\`bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/confluence-to-jira.sh \
  --url "https://sportsbet.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DATAFEEDS/pages/12907938514/" \
  --project MSPOC
\`\`\`

This will:
1. Fetch the Confluence page "DM Adapters Springboot Upgrade"
2. Extract title, requirements, and description
3. Create a JIRA ticket in project MSPOC
4. Add a link back to the Confluence page

The script uses your Atlassian credentials (same as JIRA) to access Confluence.
```

### Configuration Required

Ensure `.env` has Confluence configuration:
```bash
CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL=https://[domain].atlassian.net/wiki
# JIRA_API_TOKEN is used for both JIRA and Confluence (same Atlassian account)
```

### Error Handling

If URL is invalid or page not found:
```
The Confluence page URL seems invalid. Please check:
1. URL format is correct
2. Page ID is numeric (12907938514)
3. You have access to the page

Try: ./scripts/confluence-to-jira.sh --help
```

If authentication fails:
```
Confluence authentication failed. Ensure:
1. CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL is set in .env
2. JIRA_API_TOKEN has Confluence access
3. Your Atlassian account has permissions

Check your .env configuration.
```

## Command 6: Save Confluence Page as Spec File

### Trigger Phrases
- "save this confluence page as a spec"
- "save confluence as spec file"
- "download confluence page"
- "convert confluence to spec"
- "save confluence to specs"
- User pastes Confluence URL and mentions "save" or "spec"

### When to Use
When the user wants to save Confluence content locally as a markdown spec file for:
- Version control of Confluence documentation
- Review and editing before creating JIRA tickets
- Building a library of specs from Confluence
- Team collaboration via git

### URL Detection
Same as Command 5 - detect Confluence URLs matching patterns:
- `https://[domain].atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/[SPACE]/pages/[PAGE_ID]/[PAGE_TITLE]`
- `https://[domain].atlassian.net/wiki/x/[SHORT_ID]` (extract page ID from redirect)
- `https://[domain].atlassian.net/display/[SPACE]/[PAGE_TITLE]` (extract page ID)

Extract the numeric page ID from the URL.

### Process

1. **Identify Confluence URL or page ID** in user's message
2. **Determine output path**:
   - If user specifies: use their path
   - If not: suggest `specs/[feature-name]/spec.md` or `specs/confluence-[PAGE_ID]/spec.md`
3. **Suggest the command** with explanation of what will be created

### Command Format

```bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env

# Default location (specs/confluence-[PAGE_ID]/spec.md)
./scripts/confluence-to-spec.sh \
  --url "https://[domain].atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/[SPACE]/pages/[PAGE_ID]/"

# Custom location
./scripts/confluence-to-spec.sh \
  --url "<CONFLUENCE_URL>" \
  --output "specs/001-my-feature/spec.md"

# Using page ID directly
./scripts/confluence-to-spec.sh \
  --page-id "[PAGE_ID]" \
  --output "specs/feature/spec.md"
```

### What It Does

The script will:
1. Fetch Confluence page using REST API
2. Extract all metadata (title, author, labels, date, space, version)
3. Convert Confluence content to clean markdown
4. Generate spec file with:
   - YAML front matter with Confluence metadata
   - Title, Overview, Requirements, Technical Details
   - Full content in markdown format
   - Source link and generation date
5. Auto-create directory structure
6. Provide next steps (review file, create JIRA tickets)

### Example Interaction

**User**: "save this confluence page as a spec: https://sportsbet.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DATAFEEDS/pages/12907938514/"

**Copilot Response**:
```
I'll save that Confluence page as a local spec file:

```bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/confluence-to-spec.sh \
  --url "https://sportsbet.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DATAFEEDS/pages/12907938514/" \
  --output "specs/dm-adapters-upgrade/spec.md"
```

This will:
1. Fetch the Confluence page "DM Adapters Springboot Upgrade"
2. Extract metadata (title, author, labels, date)
3. Convert content to markdown with proper structure
4. Save to `specs/dm-adapters-upgrade/spec.md`
5. Include front matter with Confluence URL for traceability

**Next steps after saving**:
1. Review: `cat specs/dm-adapters-upgrade/spec.md`
2. Edit if needed: `vim specs/dm-adapters-upgrade/spec.md`
3. Create JIRA tickets: `./scripts/jira-create.sh --file specs/dm-adapters-upgrade/spec.md`

The spec file will be version-controlled and can be shared with your team!
```

**User**: "save confluence page 123456 to specs folder"

**Copilot Response**:
```
I'll save Confluence page 123456:

```bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/confluence-to-spec.sh \
  --page-id "123456" \
  --output "specs/confluence-123456/spec.md"
```

The spec file will include complete metadata and markdown content.
```

### Configuration Required

Same as Command 5:
```bash
# In .env
CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL=https://[domain].atlassian.net/wiki
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_token
# JIRA_API_TOKEN is used for both JIRA and Confluence (same Atlassian account)
```

### Error Handling

If URL is invalid or page not found:
```
The Confluence page URL seems invalid. Please check:
1. URL format is correct
2. Page ID is numeric
3. You have access to the page

Try: ./scripts/confluence-to-spec.sh --help
```

If authentication fails:
```
Confluence authentication failed. Ensure:
1. CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL is set in .env
2. JIRA_API_TOKEN has Confluence access
3. Your Atlassian account has permissions

Check your .env configuration.
```

If directory creation fails:
```
Could not create output directory. Please check:
1. You have write permissions
2. Path is valid
3. No conflicting files exist

Try a different output path.
```

### Workflow Integration

**Recommend this workflow** when users want to:
- Review Confluence content before creating tickets
- Version control Confluence documentation
- Collaborate on specs via git/PR

**Full workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Save Confluence page as spec
./scripts/confluence-to-spec.sh --url "..." --output "specs/feature/spec.md"

# 2. Review and edit
vim specs/feature/spec.md

# 3. Commit to version control
git add specs/feature/spec.md
git commit -m "Add feature spec from Confluence"

# 4. Create JIRA tickets
./scripts/jira-create.sh --file specs/feature/spec.md

# 5. Groom if needed
./scripts/jira-groom.sh PROJ-123
```

---

## Command 7: AI-Generated Technical Guide for JIRA Grooming

### Trigger Phrases
- "groom PROJ-123 with AI technical guide"
- "add AI-generated technical guide to PROJ-456"
- "generate technical implementation guide for PROJ-789"
- "groom with spec file"
- "enhance ticket with technical details from spec"

### When to Use
When the user wants to add a comprehensive, AI-generated technical implementation guide to a JIRA ticket based on a spec file (from Confluence or locally created).

### Process

1. **Identify the ticket key** and **spec file path**
2. **Read the spec file** to understand the technical context
3. **Generate a JIRA Atlassian Document Format (ADF) JSON** with technical guidance
4. **Include in the response**:
   - Key upgrade requirements
   - Important dependencies and libraries
   - Code changes required
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Configuration updates

### Command Format

```bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-groom.sh PROJ-123 --reference-file specs/my-feature/spec.md
```

### What This Does

1. **Fetches ticket details** from JIRA
2. **Reads the spec file** and extracts:
   - Confluence URL (from YAML front matter)
   - Technical requirements
   - Implementation details
   - Common issues
3. **Generates AI-powered technical guide** in JIRA ADF format with:
   - Proper headings (H2, H3)
   - Clickable links to Confluence documentation
   - Formatted bullet lists
   - Bold text for emphasis
   - Code snippets where appropriate
4. **Adds as JIRA comment** with rich formatting
5. **Updates description** with acceptance criteria

### Example Interaction

**User**: "groom RVV-1174 with technical guide from the betmaker spec"

**Your Response**:
```
I'll groom RVV-1174 and add an AI-generated technical implementation guide from the spec file.

First, let me find the spec file:
```

*[Search for spec files]*

```
Found: specs/betmaker-ingestor-springboot3/spec.md

I'll now generate a comprehensive technical guide based on this spec:

```bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1174 --reference-file specs/betmaker-ingestor-springboot3/spec.md
```

This will:
1. ‚úÖ Fetch ticket details for RVV-1174
2. ü§ñ Read the spec file and extract technical details
3. üìù Generate formatted technical guide with:
   - Link to Confluence documentation
   - Core upgrade requirements (Gradle, Java, Spring Boot)
   - Key libraries and dependencies
   - Required code changes
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Configuration updates
4. üí¨ Add as a formatted JIRA comment with proper headings, links, and bullet lists
5. ‚ú® Update description with 5 AI-generated acceptance criteria

The technical guide will match the quality of manually-created guides (like RVV-1171) but generated automatically!
```

### AI Generation Instructions

When generating the technical guide content, follow these rules:

1. **Extract actual content** from the spec file - don't use generic placeholders
2. **Structure with clear headings**:
   - H2: "Technical Implementation Guide - [Topic]"
   - H3: Subsections like "Reference Documentation", "Core Requirements", etc.
3. **Use JIRA ADF format**:
   - Headings: `{"type": "heading", "attrs": {"level": 2}, "content": [...]}`
   - Paragraphs: `{"type": "paragraph", "content": [...]}`
   - Bullet lists: `{"type": "bulletList", "content": [...]}`
   - Links: `{"type": "text", "text": "url", "marks": [{"type": "link", "attrs": {"href": "url"}}]}`
   - Bold: `{"marks": [{"type": "strong"}]}`
   - Code: `{"marks": [{"type": "code"}]}`
4. **Include Confluence URL** from YAML front matter if available
5. **Keep it actionable** - focus on what developers need to do
6. **Highlight common issues** - based on "Some useful notes" or similar sections

### Spec File Format

Spec files are expected to have:
- **YAML front matter** with metadata (confluence_url, title, author, etc.)
- **Markdown sections**: Overview, Requirements, Technical Details
- **Structured content** that can be parsed and formatted

Example spec structure:
```markdown

### Error Handling

If the spec file doesn't exist:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Spec file not found: specs/feature/spec.md

Would you like to:
1. Create it from a Confluence page?
   ./scripts/confluence-to-spec.sh --url "..." --output "specs/feature/spec.md"

2. Use a different spec file? (Available in specs/):
   [list existing spec files]

3. Groom without technical guide?
   ./scripts/jira-groom.sh PROJ-123
```

### Full Workflow Example

**Complete workflow** from Confluence to groomed ticket:

```bash
# Step 1: Save Confluence page as spec
./scripts/confluence-to-spec.sh \
  --url "https://sportsbet.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DATAFEEDS/pages/12907938514/" \
  --output "specs/betmaker-upgrade/spec.md"

# Step 2: Review the spec
cat specs/betmaker-upgrade/spec.md

# Step 3: Create JIRA ticket from spec (optional)
./scripts/jira-create.sh --file specs/betmaker-upgrade/spec.md

# Step 4: Groom existing ticket with AI-generated technical guide
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1174 --reference-file specs/betmaker-upgrade/spec.md
```

**Result**: A professionally formatted technical implementation guide in JIRA with:
- ‚úÖ Clickable links to Confluence
- ‚úÖ Structured headings and sections
- ‚úÖ Bullet lists with bold emphasis
- ‚úÖ Code snippets
- ‚úÖ Actionable guidance for developers
- ‚úÖ All based on the actual spec content, not templates

## Command 8: AI Story Point Estimation

### Trigger Phrases
- "estimate this ticket"
- "add story points"
- "estimate story points for this ticket"
- "groom and estimate"
- "set story points"
- "how many story points"
- "AI estimation"

### When to Use
When the user wants to estimate story points for a JIRA ticket using AI analysis of the ticket content.

### Team Context

**Racing Value Stream (RVS) Team Estimation Approach:**

- **Scale**: Linear (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) - NOT Fibonacci
- **Formula**: `base + complexity + uncertainty + testing`
- **Time Mapping**: 1 Story Point = 7 Focus Hours
- **Sprint**: 2 weeks (10 working days, 80 hours total)
- **Philosophy %**: Individual capacity per sprint (e.g., 50% = 40 hours = 6 points capacity)

**Estimation Components:**
- **Base**: 0.5 (bug/fix) or 1.0 (story/task)
- **Complexity**: 0-2 (low=0, medium=1, high=2)
- **Uncertainty**: 0-1 (none=0, medium=0.5, high=1)
- **Testing**: 0-1 (none=0, unit=0.5, integration=1)

### Process

1. **Identify the ticket key** from user context or ask
2. **Choose estimation approach**:
   - Default: Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...)
   - Team: Linear scale (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
3. **Decide interaction mode**:
   - Interactive (default): Prompts for confirmation
   - Auto-accept: For CI/CD or batch processing
   - Manual: User provides specific value

### Commands

**Interactive AI Estimation (Team Scale)**:
```bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234 --estimate --team-scale
```

**Interactive AI Estimation (Fibonacci)**:
```bash
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234 --estimate
```

**Auto-Accept Team Estimation**:
```bash
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234 --estimate --team-scale --auto-estimate
```

**Manual Story Points**:
```bash
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234 --points 3
```

**Full Groom with Estimation**:
```bash
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234 --ai-description --estimate --team-scale
```

### Example Interactions

#### Example 1: Basic Estimation Request

**User**: "estimate story points for RVV-1234"

**Your Response**:
```
I'll estimate story points for RVV-1234 using the team's linear scale (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5):

\`\`\`bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234 --estimate --team-scale
\`\`\`

This will:
1. Fetch the ticket details from JIRA
2. Analyze complexity, uncertainty, and testing needs
3. Calculate story points using the formula: base + complexity + uncertainty + testing
4. Show detailed reasoning (e.g., "2 points = 1 base + 1 complexity + 0.5 testing ‚âà 14 focus hours")
5. Ask if you want to Accept / Override / Skip the estimate

The team scale uses 1 point = 7 focus hours, based on your 2-week sprint cycle.
```

#### Example 2: Batch Estimation

**User**: "estimate all tickets in this epic with auto-accept"

**Your Response**:
```
I'll help you batch estimate tickets. First, let me find all tickets in the epic:

\`\`\`bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env

# Find tickets in epic
./scripts/find-related-tickets.sh -e EPIC-KEY -o tickets.txt

# Extract ticket keys
grep -o 'RVV-[0-9]*' tickets.txt > ticket-keys.txt

# Estimate each ticket with auto-accept
while read ticket; do
  echo "Estimating $ticket..."
  ./scripts/jira-groom.sh "$ticket" --estimate --team-scale --auto-estimate
  sleep 2  # Rate limiting
done < ticket-keys.txt
\`\`\`

This will:
- Find all tickets under the epic
- Auto-estimate each one using team scale
- Accept AI estimates without prompts
- Update JIRA with story points
```

#### Example 3: Manual Override

**User**: "set story points to 3 for RVV-1234"

**Your Response**:
```
I'll set 3 story points for RVV-1234 directly:

\`\`\`bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234 --points 3
\`\`\`

This will immediately update the ticket with 3 story points (‚âà21 focus hours) without AI analysis.
```

#### Example 4: Current File Context

**User**: "estimate this ticket" (while viewing RVV-1234 in Markdown notes)

**Your Response**:
```
I see you're viewing RVV-1234. I'll estimate story points using the team scale:

\`\`\`bash
cd jira-copilot-assistant
source .env
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234 --estimate --team-scale
\`\`\`

**What to expect:**

The AI will analyze:
- **Complexity**: Keywords like "framework upgrade", "migration", "refactor" = high (2 points)
- **Uncertainty**: Keywords like "investigate", "unknown", "TBD" = high (1 point)
- **Testing**: High complexity needs integration tests (1 point)
- **Base**: 1 point (story) or 0.5 (bug/fix)

Example output:
```
üìä AI Story Point Estimation

üîç Analysis:
Base: 1 point (new feature/story)
Complexity: +2 (high - framework/integration)
Uncertainty: +1 (significant unknowns)
Testing: +1 (integration + E2E)
Total: 5 points (~35 focus hours)

‚ö†Ô∏è  This story is large (5 points). Consider breaking it down.

Would you like to update the ticket with 5 story points?
  [a] Accept AI estimation (5 points)
  [o] Override with custom value
  [s] Skip (don't update story points)
```

### Complexity Keywords Reference

**High Complexity (+2 points):**
- framework upgrade, migration, refactor, architecture
- third-party, external API, integration, webhook
- security, authentication, authorization, encryption
- performance, optimization, caching, async

**Medium Complexity (+1 point):**
- database, schema, query, endpoint, API
- business logic, validation, error handling
- multiple, several, various, component, service

**Low Complexity (0 points):**
- simple, minor, small, quick, easy
- config, configuration, setting, flag
- typo, label, text, wording

**Uncertainty Indicators:**
- High (+1): unclear, unknown, investigate, research, TBD
- Medium (+0.5): explore, consider, evaluate, depends on

### Best Practices

1. **Use Team Scale for RVS Tickets**: `--team-scale` matches your sprint planning
2. **Large Stories (4-5 points)**: AI warns to break down - consider splitting
3. **Batch Processing**: Use `--auto-estimate` for multiple tickets
4. **Philosophy %**: Remind users that 1 SP = 7 hours, so 6 points ‚âà 1 sprint at 50% philosophy
5. **Validation**: Story points must be 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (team scale)

### Configuration

**Environment Variable** (set in `.env`):
```bash
JIRA_STORY_POINTS_FIELD=customfield_10016
```

**Finding Your Field ID**:
1. Open JIRA ticket in browser
2. DevTools > Network tab
3. Look for `customfield_` in API responses
4. Find the one labeled "Story Points"

### Error Handling

**Invalid Story Points**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Error: Invalid story points: 7. Must be one of: 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Use the team scale or switch to Fibonacci:
  --team-scale     # 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  --estimate       # 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 (Fibonacci)
```

**Missing Field Configuration**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  JIRA_STORY_POINTS_FIELD not set in .env

Add to your .env file:
  JIRA_STORY_POINTS_FIELD=customfield_10016

To find your field ID:
  1. Open any JIRA ticket
  2. DevTools > Network > Find API call
  3. Look for "customfield_" with "Story Points" label
```
