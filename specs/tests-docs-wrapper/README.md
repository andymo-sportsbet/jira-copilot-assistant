# Tests, Docs & Wrapper Initiative

This folder contains specKit-style tracking documents for the "Tests, User Setup Doc, and MCP Wrapper" initiative.

See the following docs for planning, tasks, and implementation notes:

- `plan.md` — high-level plan and milestones
- `tasks.md` — task list with owners and status
- `implementation.md` — implementation notes, PR targets, and CI details

Keep this folder as the single source of truth for this initiative. Update files as tasks progress.
