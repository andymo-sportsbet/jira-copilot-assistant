# Migration plan: My-projects/jira-copilot-assistant â†’ new repo

Goal

- Detect any differences or missing files/commits between the old monorepo path `My-projects/jira-copilot-assistant` and this new repository `andymo-sportsbet/jira-copilot-assistant`.
- Provide a migration plan that either preserves commit history (recommended) or copies a snapshot if history isn't required.

Detection steps (what I ran)

1. Clone the old monorepo (shallow) to a temporary location:

   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/andymo-sportsbet/My-projects.git /tmp/My-projects

2. Copy the `jira-copilot-assistant` subdirectory out:

   mkdir -p /tmp/old-jira
   cp -R /tmp/My-projects/jira-copilot-assistant/. /tmp/old-jira/

3. Compare old vs new repo contents:

   diff -ruN /tmp/old-jira /Users/andym/jira-copilot-assistant | less

4. List commits in the old monorepo touching the subdirectory:

   git -C /tmp/My-projects log --pretty=format:"%h %ad %an %s" --date=iso -- jira-copilot-assistant | less

Migration options

- Preserve history (recommended): use `git subtree split` to extract the `jira-copilot-assistant` subtree into a branch, push it to the new repo, open a PR, review and merge.

- Snapshot (fast): rsync/copy files from the old subdir into this repo, commit, open a PR, review and merge. Loses original commit history but is simpler.

Post-migration checklist

- Transfer repository settings: branch protection, CODEOWNERS, CI checks.
- Transfer Actions secrets and webhooks (manual/API).
- Re-run CI and tests.
- Update README, badges and documentation pointing to the new repo.
- Optionally archive or remove the old subdirectory and add a pointer to the new repo.

Recommendation

- If commit history matters: run the `git subtree split` approach and push a split branch to this repo for review.
- If you just need the latest files: use the snapshot rsync approach and commit directly on a branch, then open a PR.

Next steps I will run now

- Run the read-only detection steps (clone old monorepo shallow, copy subdir, produce a file diff and list commits touching the subdir). I will save the detection results (summary) in `specs/migration-plan.md` next.
