# Onboarding / User Guides

This folder contains contributor- and user-facing quickstart and onboarding docs.

- Canonical files proposed here:
- `user-guide.md` (full reference)
- `user-setup.md` (local setup and secrets guidance)
- `contribution-guide.md` (contributor workflow)
- `QUICK-START-GUIDE.md` (could remain in root docs or be copied here)

Current plan: copy `docs/onboarding/*` content into this folder (or move if approved). Keep original top-level copies until you confirm.
