## 📊 Flexibility Comparison

### Scenario 1: Custom Workflow Variation

#### **Power User Need:**
"I want to groom 5 tickets at once, then estimate them all, then create a summary"

#### **With Prompt File (Flexible ✅):**

**User asks Copilot:**
```
"Groom tickets RVV-1234, RVV-1235, RVV-1236, RVV-1237, RVV-1238, 
 add estimation to each, then create a summary report"
```

**Copilot interprets prompt file + context:**
```bash
# Copilot suggests creative bash combination:
for ticket in RVV-{1234..1238}; do
  ./scripts/jira-groom.sh $ticket --estimate
done

# Then generate summary
./scripts/jira-search.sh --jql "key in (RVV-1234,RVV-1235,RVV-1236,RVV-1237,RVV-1238)" \
  | jq -r '.issues[] | "\(.key): \(.fields.customfield_storypoints) SP"'
```

**Power user can:**
- ✅ Modify the loop
- ✅ Add custom filtering
- ✅ Pipe to other commands
- ✅ Adjust JQL query
- ✅ Change output format

**Result:** Flexible, powerful, customizable

---

#### **With MCP (Structured ⚠️):**

**User asks Copilot:**
```
"Groom tickets RVV-1234 through RVV-1238 with estimation and summary"
```

**MCP server limitations:**
```python
# MCP only has predefined tools:
@server.tool()
async def groom_ticket(ticket_id: str, estimate: bool):
    # Can only groom ONE ticket at a time
    # No batch support unless explicitly coded
    
@server.tool()
async def create_summary(ticket_ids: list[str]):
    # Would need to be pre-built
    # Can't be created on-the-fly
```

**Copilot response:**
```
"I can groom tickets one by one:
1. groom_ticket("RVV-1234", estimate=True)
2. groom_ticket("RVV-1235", estimate=True)
...

But I don't have a summary tool. Would you like me to 
call groom_ticket 5 times?"
```

**Power user can:**
- ⚠️ Only use predefined tools
- ⚠️ Can't easily batch operations
- ⚠️ Can't pipe to custom commands
- ⚠️ Limited to what MCP server coded

**Result:** Structured, but inflexible for custom workflows

---

### Scenario 2: Creative Command Chaining

#### **Power User Need:**
"Find all tickets with 'migration' in title, groom them, estimate, then update a tracking spreadsheet"

#### **With Prompt File (Flexible ✅):**

**User asks:**
```
"Find migration tickets, groom them, estimate, export to CSV"
```

**Copilot suggests:**
```bash
# Creative combination of your scripts + standard tools
./scripts/jira-search.sh --jql "summary ~ migration AND status = 'To Do'" | \
  jq -r '.issues[].key' | \
  while read ticket; do
    ./scripts/jira-groom.sh "$ticket" --estimate
  done

# Then export
./scripts/jira-search.sh --jql "summary ~ migration" | \
  jq -r '.issues[] | [.key, .fields.summary, .fields.customfield_storypoints] | @csv' \
  > migration-tickets.csv
```

**Power user can:**
- ✅ Add grep filters
- ✅ Change JQL query on the fly
- ✅ Pipe to Excel, Google Sheets, Slack
- ✅ Add custom transformations
- ✅ Run in background (`&`)
- ✅ Schedule with cron

**Result:** Unlimited creativity

---

#### **With MCP (Structured ⚠️):**

**MCP would need:**
```python
# Tool 1: Search tickets
@server.tool()
async def search_tickets(jql: str) -> list[str]:
    # Returns ticket IDs
    
# Tool 2: Batch groom (would need to be coded)
@server.tool()
async def batch_groom(ticket_ids: list[str], estimate: bool):
    # Process each ticket
    
# Tool 3: Export to CSV (would need to be coded)
@server.tool()
async def export_to_csv(ticket_ids: list[str], filename: str):
    # Export functionality
```

**Problems:**
- ⚠️ Every workflow must be pre-coded
- ⚠️ Can't do ad-hoc chaining
- ⚠️ Limited to implemented tools
- ⚠️ Power user can't customize on-the-fly

**Result:** Only works if someone coded it first

---

### Scenario 3: Context-Aware Parameter Extraction

#### **Power User Need:**
"I'm looking at a spec file, want to create ticket AND immediately groom it with this Confluence page"

#### **With Prompt File (Flexible ✅):**

**User has open:**
- `specs/001-feature/spec.md` (current file)
- Confluence URL in browser: `https://sportsbet.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TECH/pages/123456/`

**User asks:**
```
"Create ticket from this spec and groom it with that Confluence page"
```

**Copilot reads prompt file instructions:**
```markdown
When user says "this spec" or "this file":
  - Read current file path
  - Extract title from first heading
  - Use as summary

When user says "that Confluence page":
  - Check if URL is in clipboard, recent browser tabs, or chat history
  - Extract page ID
```

**Copilot suggests:**
```bash
# Extract from context automatically
TICKET=$(./scripts/jira-create.sh \
  --file specs/001-feature/spec.md \
  --project RVV | grep -o 'RVV-[0-9]*')

# Then groom with Confluence
./scripts/jira-groom.sh "$TICKET" \
  --confluence-url "https://sportsbet.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TECH/pages/123456/"

echo "Created and groomed: $TICKET"
```

**Power user can:**
- ✅ Copilot extracted spec path from context
- ✅ Copilot inferred project from file location
- ✅ Copilot grabbed Confluence URL from environment
- ✅ Commands chained automatically
- ✅ Can modify the chain before running

**Result:** Smart, context-aware, flexible

---

#### **With MCP (Structured ⚠️):**

**MCP requires explicit parameters:**
```python
@server.tool()
async def create_ticket(spec_file: str, project: str) -> str:
    # Needs EXACT file path as string
    # Can't infer from "this file"
    
@server.tool()
async def groom_with_confluence(ticket_id: str, confluence_url: str):
    # Needs EXACT URL as string
    # Can't infer from "that page"
```

**User must specify everything:**
```
User: "Create ticket from specs/001-feature/spec.md in project RVV, 
       then groom it with confluence URL 
       https://sportsbet.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TECH/pages/123456/"
```

**Problems:**
- ⚠️ Can't say "this file" - must provide full path
- ⚠️ Can't say "that page" - must paste URL
- ⚠️ More typing, less natural
- ⚠️ No context inference

**Result:** Precise but verbose

---

## 🔧 Power User Flexibility Examples

### Example 1: Custom Filtering

#### **Prompt File Power:**
```bash
# Power user asks: "Groom all high-priority tickets assigned to me"

# Copilot suggests:
./scripts/jira-search.sh \
  --jql "assignee = currentUser() AND priority = High AND status = 'To Do'" | \
  jq -r '.issues[].key' | \
  xargs -I {} ./scripts/jira-groom.sh {} --estimate

# Power user modifies:
./scripts/jira-search.sh \
  --jql "assignee = currentUser() AND priority = High AND status = 'To Do'" | \
  jq -r '.issues[].key' | \
  parallel -j 4 ./scripts/jira-groom.sh {} --estimate  # ← Added parallel processing!
```

**Flexibility:**
- ✅ Changed `xargs` to `parallel` for speed
- ✅ Added `-j 4` for concurrent execution
- ✅ Can add more filters on the fly
- ✅ Can pipe to Slack notification
- ✅ Can save to file

#### **MCP Limitation:**
```python
# MCP would need explicit batch processing tool
# Power user can't add parallelization without coding
```

---

### Example 2: Custom Output Formatting

#### **Prompt File Power:**
```bash
# Power user asks: "Show me story points for all in-progress tickets in a table"

# Copilot suggests:
./scripts/jira-search.sh \
  --jql "status = 'In Progress'" | \
  jq -r '.issues[] | [.key, .fields.summary, .fields.customfield_storypoints] | @tsv' | \
  column -t -s $'\t'

# Power user enhances:
./scripts/jira-search.sh \
  --jql "status = 'In Progress'" | \
  jq -r '.issues[] | [.key, .fields.summary, .fields.customfield_storypoints] | @tsv' | \
  column -t -s $'\t' | \
  tee current-sprint.txt | \
  mail -s "Current Sprint Status" team@company.com  # ← Added email!
```

**Flexibility:**
- ✅ Used `tee` to save AND display
- ✅ Added email notification
- ✅ Can pipe to Excel conversion
- ✅ Can add to dashboard
- ✅ Unlimited creativity

#### **MCP Limitation:**
```python
# MCP would need separate tools for:
# - Getting tickets
# - Formatting output
# - Saving to file
# - Sending email
# Each would need to be pre-coded
```

---

### Example 3: Emergency Workflows

#### **Prompt File Power:**

**Scenario: Production incident, need to quickly audit all recent changes**

```bash
# Power user asks: "Show me all tickets closed in last 3 days with their PRs"

# Copilot suggests:
./scripts/jira-search.sh \
  --jql "status = Done AND resolved >= -3d" | \
  jq -r '.issues[] | .key' | \
  while read ticket; do
    echo "=== $ticket ==="
    ./scripts/github-search.sh "$ticket" | jq -r '.items[] | .html_url'
  done

# Power user adds incident tracking:
./scripts/jira-search.sh \
  --jql "status = Done AND resolved >= -3d" | \
  jq -r '.issues[] | .key' | \
  while read ticket; do
    echo "=== $ticket ==="
    ./scripts/github-search.sh "$ticket" | jq -r '.items[] | .html_url'
    git log --grep="$ticket" --oneline  # ← Added git log search
  done > incident-audit-$(date +%Y%m%d).log  # ← Save with timestamp
```

**Flexibility:**
- ✅ Created on-the-fly audit script
- ✅ Added git log checking
- ✅ Timestamped output file
- ✅ Can add diff inspection
- ✅ Can integrate with PagerDuty
- ✅ **Total time: 2 minutes**

#### **MCP Limitation:**
```python
# MCP would need:
# - audit_tickets tool (pre-coded)
# - search_prs tool (pre-coded)  
# - git_log tool (pre-coded)
# - save_audit tool (pre-coded)

# If emergency workflow wasn't pre-built: 
# Power user is BLOCKED until someone codes it
# **Time to build: 2 hours - 2 days**
```

## 🎨 Prompt File Advantages for Power Users

### 1. **Natural Language Flexibility**

**Prompt file allows variations:**
```
"Groom ticket RVV-1234"
"Enhance RVV-1234 with AI"
"Add acceptance criteria to RVV-1234"
"Update RVV-1234 with better description"
"Make RVV-1234 ready for refinement"
```

**All map to same command:**
```bash
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234
```

**MCP requires exact tool names:**
```
groom_ticket("RVV-1234")  # ← Only this works
```

---

### 2. **Context Inference**

**Prompt file can read:**
- Current file path
- Git branch name
- Clipboard content
- Recent terminal commands
- Open browser tabs (via history)
- Chat history

**Example:**
```
User (looking at file specs/feature-x/spec.md on branch feature/ABC-123):
  "Create ticket for this"

Copilot infers:
  - File: specs/feature-x/spec.md
  - Project: ABC (from branch name)
  - Type: Story (from spec structure)

Suggests:
  ./scripts/jira-create.sh --file specs/feature-x/spec.md --project ABC --type Story
```

**MCP can't infer** - needs explicit parameters.

---

### 3. **Bash Ecosystem Access**

**Power users can use entire bash ecosystem:**

```bash
# Pipe to any tool
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234 | grep "Story Points" | awk '{print $3}'

# Use shell features
for ticket in $(cat ticket-list.txt); do
  ./scripts/jira-groom.sh $ticket &
done
wait

# Combine with git
git log --oneline | grep -o 'RVV-[0-9]*' | xargs -I {} ./scripts/jira-groom.sh {}

# Use process substitution
diff <(./scripts/jira-search.sh --jql "sprint = current") \
     <(./scripts/jira-search.sh --jql "sprint = previous")

# Background jobs
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234 > log.txt 2>&1 &

# Conditional execution
./scripts/jira-create.sh --file spec.md && ./scripts/jira-groom.sh $(cat /tmp/last-ticket)

# Error handling
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234 || echo "Failed, trying again" && \
  ./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234
```

**MCP can't do any of this** without explicit coding.

---

### 4. **Ad-hoc Modifications**

**Prompt file scenario:**
```
User: "Groom RVV-1234 but skip the Confluence lookup"

Copilot suggests:
  ./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234 --no-confluence

Wait, that flag doesn't exist yet!

Copilot then suggests:
  # Quick workaround:
  SKIP_CONFLUENCE=true ./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234
```

**Power user can:**
- ✅ Set environment variables
- ✅ Comment out sections of script
- ✅ Patch script temporarily
- ✅ Fork script for one-off use

**MCP:**
- ⚠️ Must wait for developer to add `skip_confluence` parameter
- ⚠️ Can't work around it

---
