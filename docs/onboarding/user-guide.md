# User Guide

This folder contains onboarding documents for users and contributors. See the specific guides:

- `user-setup.md` — quickstart for setting up your development environment (local tests, `gh` commands)
- `contribution-guide.md` — contributor workflow, PR process, and permissions

These files are copies of the top-level guides but organized under `docs/onboarding/` for discoverability.
