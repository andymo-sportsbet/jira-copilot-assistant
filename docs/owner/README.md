# Owner / Admin Documentation

This folder should contain admin and owner-focused documents (bot setup, secrets, repo configuration, CI with protected secrets).

Suggested files to live here:
- `owner-setup.md` (already present)
- `approval-and-collaboration.md` (approval process and CODEOWNERS)
- Any docs referencing how to create the bot/service account and set `BOT_SELF_APPROVE_TOKEN`.

Current plan: move `owner-setup.md` here and keep other owner/admin docs. Non-destructive copy first for review.
