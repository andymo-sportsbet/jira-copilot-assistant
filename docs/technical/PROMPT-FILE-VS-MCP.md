# Prompt Files vs Local MCP: Architecture Comparison

## TL;DR

**Current bash solution uses `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (prompt file) to guide Copilot.**  
**Local MCP provides more structured tool definitions.**

**Verdict: Local MCP is better for long-term, but both can coexist!**

## 🏗️ Current Architecture (Prompt File Based)

### How It Works

```
User asks in Copilot Chat: "Groom ticket RVV-1234"
        ↓
Copilot reads: .github/copilot-instructions.md (1,291 lines)
        ↓
Copilot sees: "When user asks to groom, suggest: ./scripts/jira-groom.sh"
        ↓
Copilot suggests: "./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1234"
        ↓
User clicks to run
        ↓
Bash script executes
```

### What's in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

Your file contains:
- **1,291 lines** of instructions
- **7 command patterns** (create, groom, close, etc.)
- **Trigger phrases** for each command
- **Parameter extraction rules**
- **Example workflows**
- **Error handling guidance**

### Strengths ✅

1. **Works Today**
   - ✅ No setup needed
   - ✅ Already integrated
   - ✅ Copilot reads it automatically

2. **Flexible**
   - ✅ Natural language instructions
   - ✅ Can describe complex logic
   - ✅ Easy to update (just edit markdown)

3. **Context-Aware**
   - ✅ Copilot analyzes current file
   - ✅ Extracts parameters from context
   - ✅ Smart suggestions based on workspace

4. **No Code Changes**
   - ✅ Bash scripts unchanged
   - ✅ Pure documentation approach
   - ✅ Non-technical folks can update instructions

### Weaknesses ⚠️

1. **Reliability**
   - ⚠️ Copilot may misinterpret instructions
   - ⚠️ Long instruction file (1,291 lines)
   - ⚠️ Copilot might hallucinate parameters
   - ⚠️ No guaranteed structure

2. **Discoverability**
   - ⚠️ User must know what to ask
   - ⚠️ No auto-complete for tools
   - ⚠️ Can't list available commands easily

3. **Execution**
   - ⚠️ Two-step process (suggest → user runs)
   - ⚠️ User must copy/paste or click
   - ⚠️ No automatic execution

4. **Validation**
   - ⚠️ No parameter validation before suggesting
   - ⚠️ Copilot might suggest wrong parameters
   - ⚠️ Errors only caught when script runs

## 🚀 Local MCP Architecture

### How It Would Work

```
User asks in Copilot Chat: "Groom ticket RVV-1234"
        ↓
Copilot queries MCP server: "What tools are available?"
        ↓
MCP returns structured tool list:
  - groom_ticket(ticket_id: str, estimate: bool)
  - create_ticket(spec_file: str, project: str)
  - etc.
        ↓
Copilot calls: groom_ticket("RVV-1234", estimate=false)
        ↓
MCP server executes: subprocess.run(["./scripts/jira-groom.sh", "RVV-1234"])
        ↓
Result returned to chat automatically
```

### What MCP Server Provides

```python
# Structured tool definitions
@server.tool()
async def groom_ticket(
    ticket_id: str,           # Required parameter
    estimate: bool = False    # Optional parameter
):
    """
    Groom a JIRA ticket with AI enhancements.
    
    Args:
        ticket_id: JIRA ticket key (e.g., 'RVV-1234')
        estimate: Whether to add AI story point estimation
        
    Returns:
        Enhanced ticket with acceptance criteria
    """
    # Call bash script
    args = [ticket_id]
    if estimate:
        args.append("--estimate")
    
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["./scripts/jira-groom.sh"] + args,
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )
    
    return {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": result.stdout}]}
```

### Strengths ✅

1. **Structured & Reliable**
   - ✅ **Typed parameters** - Copilot knows exact types
   - ✅ **Validation** - Parameters validated before execution
   - ✅ **Guaranteed structure** - No misinterpretation
   - ✅ **Auto-discovery** - Copilot sees all available tools

2. **Better UX**
   - ✅ **Auto-execution** - No manual copy/paste
   - ✅ **Faster** - One step instead of two
   - ✅ **Discoverable** - Type `@` to see tools
   - ✅ **Auto-complete** - Parameter suggestions

3. **Ecosystem**
   - ✅ **Industry standard** - MCP protocol
   - ✅ **Multi-tool support** - Works with Claude, Copilot, future AIs
   - ✅ **Composable** - AI can chain tools
   - ✅ **Shareable** - Other teams can use your MCP server

4. **Error Handling**

Local MCP Server (new)
    ↓ For users who want chat-first UX
    ↓
.github/copilot-instructions.md (keep!)
    ↓ For users who prefer CLI suggestions
    ↓
Bash Scripts (unchanged)
    ↓ Core logic stays the same
```

**Why:**
- ✅ Both approaches available
- ✅ Users choose their preference
- ✅ Gradual migration, no force
- ✅ MCP enhances, doesn't replace

**Configuration:**
```json
// mcp.json (new users)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira-copilot": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["mcp-server/server.py"]
    }
  }
}

// .github/copilot-instructions.md (all users)
// Still used by Copilot for context and suggestions
```

---

### **Phase 3: Long-term (MCP Primary)**

```
Most users: Local MCP (chat-first, auto-execute)
    +
Power users: CLI (terminal, scripts, automation)
    +
Both supported: Choose your workflow
```
