# Technical Documentation

Developer- and architecture-focused docs should live here.

Suggested contents:
- `README.md` (root README links into here)
- `mcp-server/` references and integration docs
- `setup-guide.md` (could remain here or in onboarding depending on audience)
- `troubleshooting.md` (short troubleshooting for devs)
- `scripts/` or `specs/` reference docs

This folder is for anything that developers and maintainers need to configure or debug.
