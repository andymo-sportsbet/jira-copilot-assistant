## 🎯 What is Story Point Estimation?

Story points measure **effort + complexity + uncertainty**, not time.

### Fibonacci Scale (Most Common)

| Points | Effort | Duration | Example |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| **1** | Trivial | 1-2 hours | Config change, typo fix |
| **2** | Simple | Half day | Add validation, update docs |
| **3** | Medium | 1 day | New API endpoint, simple feature |
| **5** | Complex | 2 days | Feature with tests, integration |
| **8** | Very Complex | 3 days | Framework upgrade, complex feature |
| **13** | Large | 1 week | Major feature, architectural change |
| **21+** | Epic | 2+ weeks | **Should be broken down** |

### What Affects Estimation?

1. **Effort** - How much work? (code, tests, docs)
2. **Complexity** - How difficult? (algorithm, integration)
3. **Uncertainty** - How well understood? (clear vs vague)
4. **Risk** - What could go wrong? (dependencies, legacy code)

## 🤖 How AI Estimation Would Work

### Analysis Factors

```
Base Points (by task type):
- Simple config/fix: 1-2 points
- New feature: 3-5 points
- Complex feature: 8 points
- Framework upgrade: 5 points

+ Complexity Multipliers:
- Multiple components: +2
- External integrations: +2
- Legacy code: +2-3
- New technology: +3

+ Uncertainty Factors:
- Unclear requirements: +2
- Many dependencies: +1-2
- Unknown issues: +1-2

+ Testing Overhead:
- Integration tests: +1
- E2E tests: +2

= Total (rounded to Fibonacci)
```

### Example: Spring Boot Upgrade

**Ticket:** "[Service Name] Spring Boot upgrade"

**AI Analysis:**
```
Base: 5 points (framework upgrade)
+ 2 points (integration testing required)
+ 1 point (dependency updates)
+ 1 point (documentation)
= 9 points → rounds to 8 (Fibonacci)

Reasoning:
• Framework upgrade is well-understood (+0 uncertainty)
• Requires testing across multiple services (+2)
• Dependencies need updating (+1)
• Standard process with clear steps (-0 risk)

Recommended: 8 story points
```

## 📝 Planned Usage (Not Yet Implemented)

### Option 1: AI Estimation

```bash
# Groom with AI estimation
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1171 --estimate

# Output:
# 🤖 AI Estimation Analysis:
#    Task Type: Framework Upgrade
#    Complexity: Medium-High
#    Recommended: 8 story points
#    Reasoning: Framework upgrade with integration testing...
```

### Option 2: Manual Override

```bash
# Specify story points manually
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1171 --estimate --points 5
```

### Option 3: Combined with AI Description

```bash
# Full AI-powered grooming
./scripts/jira-groom.sh RVV-1171 \
  --ai-description .temp/description.txt \
  --estimate
```

## 🔍 Estimation Examples

### Example 1: Simple Task (1 point)

**Ticket:** "Update Redis timeout configuration"

```
Effort: Minimal (1 config file)
Complexity: Low (known config)
Uncertainty: None (clear requirement)
Testing: Quick smoke test

Estimate: 1 point
```

### Example 2: Medium Task (3 points)

**Ticket:** "Add user profile API endpoint"

```
Effort: Moderate (controller + service + tests)
Complexity: Medium (standard CRUD)
Uncertainty: Low (common pattern)
Testing: Unit + integration

Estimate: 3 points
```

### Example 3: Complex Task (8 points)

**Ticket:** "Betmaker Feed Adapter Spring Boot 3 upgrade"

```
Base: 5 (framework upgrade)
+ 2 (integration testing across services)
+ 1 (dependency updates: Racing BOM, shared libs)
+ 0 (well-understood process)
= 8 points

Reasoning:
• Framework upgrade is standard but requires care
• Need to validate data transformation logic
• Multiple downstream consumers to test
• Clear upgrade path reduces uncertainty
```

### Example 4: Should Split (13+ points)

**Ticket:** "New payment gateway integration"

```
Initial Estimate: 21 points

Better approach - Split into:
• 5 points: API integration layer
• 3 points: Payment processing logic
• 3 points: Error handling & retries
• 2 points: Testing & documentation

Total: 13 points across 4 stories
```

## 📊 JIRA Configuration

### Find Story Points Field

JIRA uses custom fields for story points. Common names:
- `customfield_10016` - "Story Points"
- `customfield_10026` - "Estimate"
- `customfield_xxxxx` - "Story Point Estimate"

### Find Your Field ID

```bash
# Get your JIRA issue and look for story points field
curl -u EMAIL:TOKEN \
  "https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/RVV-1171" \
  | jq '.fields | to_entries | .[] | select(.key | startswith("customfield"))'
```

### Configure .env

```bash
# Add to .env file (when feature is implemented)
JIRA_STORY_POINTS_FIELD="customfield_10016"
```

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Use Relative Sizing
```
Don't ask: "How many hours?"
Ask: "Is this bigger or smaller than our typical 5-pointer?"
```

### 2. Include Everything
- Development
- Testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Code review
- Documentation
- Deployment/rollout

### 3. Account for Unknowns
```
Clear requirements: baseline
Some unknowns: +1-2 points
Many unknowns: +3-5 points
Complete uncertainty: Do a spike first!
```

### 4. When in Doubt, Go Higher
```
Between 5 and 8? → Choose 8
Better to finish early than run over
```

### 5. Break Down Large Tasks
```
If > 13 points:
1. Identify logical breakpoints
2. Estimate each piece
3. Ensure pieces can be delivered independently
```

## 💡 Quick Reference

### Estimation Cheat Sheet

```
1 point  = 1-2 hours   = Trivial change
2 points = Half day    = Simple task
3 points = 1 day       = Standard story
5 points = 2 days      = Meaty story  
8 points = 3 days      = Complex story
13 points = 1 week     = Large (consider splitting)
21+ points = 2+ weeks  = Definitely split!
```

### Quick Estimation Questions

1. **How complex is it?** (Low/Medium/High)
2. **How well do we understand it?** (Clear/Some unknowns/Many unknowns)
3. **How much testing is needed?** (Unit/Integration/E2E/All)
4. **What similar work have we done?** (Use as baseline)
5. **What could go wrong?** (Dependencies, unknowns, risks)

### Common Adjustments

```
Framework upgrade: 5-8 base points
+ Multiple services: +2
+ Integration testing: +1-2
+ Legacy code changes: +2-3
+ New technology: +3
+ External dependencies: +1-2
+ Documentation: +1
```

## 📚 Resources

### Agile Estimation Techniques

- **Planning Poker** - Team estimates together
- **T-Shirt Sizing** - Quick rough estimates (XS, S, M, L, XL)
- **Relative Sizing** - Compare to known stories
- **Affinity Grouping** - Group similar-sized stories

### Why Fibonacci?

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...

Benefits:
✅ Forces range thinking (not false precision)
✅ Larger gaps = more uncertainty at higher values
✅ Easy to agree on (not 7 vs 8)
✅ Industry standard (easy onboarding)
```

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Estimating in hours** → Use story points
❌ **Individual estimates** → Should be team consensus
❌ **Too precise** → "7.5 points" defeats the purpose
❌ **Ignoring complexity** → It's not just time
❌ **Not re-estimating** → Update when requirements change
❌ **Estimating too early** → Wait until ticket is groomed

## 🎬 Current Status

**Feature Status:** ⚠️ **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

This is a planning document for a future feature. Currently:
- ✅ Estimation guide written
- ✅ Algorithm designed
- ✅ Examples documented
- ⏳ Implementation pending

**For now:** Add story points manually in JIRA after grooming tickets.

**Coming soon:** 
```bash
./scripts/jira-groom.sh TICKET-123 --estimate
# AI will analyze and suggest story points
```

---

## 📝 Example Workflow (Future)

```bash
# 1. Find tickets to groom
./scripts/find-related-tickets.sh -e RVV-1178 -o .temp/tickets.txt

# 2. Generate descriptions
# (Use AI/templates to create descriptions)

# 3. Groom with AI description AND estimation
for ticket in $(cat .temp/tickets.txt); do
  ./scripts/jira-groom.sh "$ticket" \
    --ai-description ".temp/${ticket}-desc.txt" \
    --estimate
done

# 4. Review estimates in JIRA
# Check that AI suggestions make sense
# Adjust if needed

# 5. Sprint planning
# Use story points for capacity planning
```

## 🎯 Summary

**Estimation helps with:**
- ✅ Sprint planning (know team capacity)
- ✅ Prioritization (effort vs value)
- ✅ Progress tracking (velocity trends)
- ✅ Team alignment (shared understanding)

**AI Estimation will provide:**
- 🤖 Automatic analysis of ticket complexity
- 📊 Suggested story points with reasoning
- ⚡ Fast batch estimation for epics
- 📈 Consistency across similar tickets

**Remember:**
- Story points are **relative**, not absolute
