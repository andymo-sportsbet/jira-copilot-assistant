## Development Guidelines

### Bash Scripts

- Use `set -euo pipefail` for main scripts (but NOT in library files)
- Add proper error handling with informative messages
- Include `--help` flag with usage examples
- Test on both macOS and Linux when possible
- Use meaningful variable names (lowercase for local, UPPERCASE for globals)
- Add comments for complex logic

### Python (MCP Server)

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use Python 3.13+ features
- Add type hints for function parameters and returns
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Test with `test_mcp_client.py` before submitting

### Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add examples to relevant docs/ files
- Keep .env.example synchronized with required variables
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful

## Code Style

### Bash

```bash
# Use 2-space indentation
function example_function() {
  local param="$1"
  
  if [[ -z "$param" ]]; then
    error "Parameter required"
    return 1
  fi
  
  info "Processing: $param"
}
```

### Python

```python
# Use 4-space indentation, type hints, docstrings
def example_function(param: str) -> bool:
    """
    Brief description of function.
    
    Args:
        param: Description of parameter
        
    Returns:
        True if successful, False otherwise
    """
    if not param:
        return False
    
    return True
```

## Testing

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Test all modified scripts end-to-end
- [ ] Verify MCP integration still works (if applicable)
- [ ] Check for hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- [ ] Run existing test scripts in `mcp-server/`
- [ ] Test with different JIRA ticket types (Story, Bug, Spike, Tech Debt)

### Test Commands

```bash
# Test bash scripts
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
./scripts/jira-groom.sh --help

# Test MCP server
cd mcp-server
source venv/bin/activate
python test_mcp_client.py
```
